This README will be updated throughout the project and work as a diary.

Project planning with time estimates is almost done. Unfortunately the UPPMAX account wasn't activated, so the genome assembly couldn't get started. Hopefully, tomorrow the account will get accepted and the bash file can be written and executed from home. In that case, I can continue the thursday session without unnecessary waiting time for the genome assembly.

Since Uppmax will be shut down until monday next week, I took some extra time getting even more familiar with the article. I also went through the lecture slides for the De novo genome assembly, to get some answers for the "To think about" part underneath the Genome and Metagenome Assembly in the student manual. The question part underneath the Assembly evaluation also hade some answers in the lecture slides.

Uppmax is still shut down due to maintenance. However, today we were able to download the files needed for the genome assembly. I added folders with guidence from the student manual. Hopefully, this will be a structured help later on in the analysis. I will try to do the genome assembly locally from home on my own computer. This will help the progress since Uppmax will most likely be shut down untill friday this week.

Today Uppmax was up and running! The genome assembly batch file was completed, and after som trail and error the work was succesfully uploaded to Uppmax. Therefore, all the thoughts of doing the genome assembly locally at home went out the window. Today's practise was really good and I got more familiar with the interface of Uppmax, and also how to get the batch file to work. Eva and Guilherme were super helpful and stayed over time.
