Project planning with time estimates is almost done. Unfortunately the UPPMAX account wasn't activated, so the genome assembly couldn't get started. Hopefully, tomorrow the account will get accepted and the bash file can be written and executed from home. In that case, I can continue the thursday session without unnecessary waiting time for the genome assembly.
