Project planning with time estimates is almost done. Unfortunately the UPPMAX account wasn't activated, so the genome assembly couldn't get started. Hopefully, tomorrow the account will get accepted and the bash file can be written and executed from home. In that case, I can continue the thursday session without unnecessary waiting time for the genome assembly.

Since Uppmax will be shut down until monday next week, I took some extra time getting even more familiar with the article. I also went through the lecture slides for the De novo genome assembly, to get some answers for the "To think about" part underneath the Genome and Metagenome Assembly in the student manual. The question part underneath the Assembly evaluation also hade some answers in the lecture slides.
